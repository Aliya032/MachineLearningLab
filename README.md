# Machine Learning Programs 

These are simle ML programs showing how different ML Algorithms work. The datasets used here are: [The Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset) and [The Cars Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/cars-purchase-decision-dataset).

- All of these are executed in Jupyter Notebook
